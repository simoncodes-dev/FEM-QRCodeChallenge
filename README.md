## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox

### What I learned

That CSS is still difficult to me! I struggle still with making the images scale to the container, and I'm a little worried that if I was to add text to the box, the text would overflow rather than the container stretching because I've used absolute heights and widths.

I need to continue working on my CSS skills, although I generally find myself design-challenged! 

### Useful resources

- [A Complete Guide to Flexbox (CSS Tricks)](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Essential for helping me build the very basics of my flexbox.
- [Responsive Web Design - Media Queries (W3 Schools)](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_rwd_mediaqueries.asp) - Gave me the example on how to use a media query based on px values. .
